# Summary

This is basically a experiment that I'm doing to learn firebase/ React native with expo

## How to run

First of all you'll need to create a firebase project, enable email/password auth and create a .env with the following credentials

```
APIKEY=string
AUTHDOMAIN=string
PROJECTID=string
STORAGEBUCKET=string
MESSAGINGSENDERID=string
APPID=string
```

Then with a terminal window open on the folder, run the following commands

```bash
yarn install

yarn start
```
